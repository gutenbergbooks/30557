<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>


<p>This manual has been prepared as a guide to the Information Network
Service, the interlibrary loan system of the Long Island Library
Resources Council (LILRC).</p>

<p>The manual contains a description of how the location and delivery
service works and the policy on which it is based, as well as
standards to which it is expected participating libraries will adhere.</p>

<p>Please do not hesitate to make suggestions and comments regarding
this manual and the interlibrary loan service to the Council office.</p>

<h2><a name="INTERLIBRARY_LOAN_POLICIES_AND_PROCEDURES" id="INTERLIBRARY_LOAN_POLICIES_AND_PROCEDURES"></a>INTERLIBRARY LOAN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</h2>


<p>Our interlibrary loan program is based on the premise that lending among
libraries for the benefit of individuals in Nassau and Suffolk counties is
in the public interest and should be encouraged. It is impossible for any
one library to be self-sufficient, and interlibrary borrowing and lending is
regarded by the libraries participating in this program as essential to
library service.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the Council that the routines of borrowing and lending
are simplified as much as possible consistent with the protection of material.
Every effort is made to emphasize speed and to base the service on a spirit
of cooperation and trust among participating libraries.</p>

<p>What follows comprise the procedures and standards that have developed gradually
and voluntarily in our area&mdash;this is what works for us. Changes may be introduced
as the need arises.</p>


<h3>What may be borrowed</h3>

<p>It is recognized that interlibrary borrowing does not relieve any library of the
responsibility for developing its own collection. Each library should provide
the bulk of materials needed by its users for purposes of study, instruction,
information and research.</p>

<p>The borrowing library should make every effort to exhaust its own resources
before turning to interlibrary loan. It should also screen requests carefully
before transmitting them to the Council, eliminating those which common sense
indicates would not be supplied.</p>

<p>The borrowing library is responsible for returning loans promptly and in good
condition. The borrowing library should respond quickly to overdue notices
and is responsible for paying fees for lost books as levied by the lending library.
The library should refuse to request books on interlibrary loan on behalf of
borrowers who abuse the privilege.</p>


<h3>Placing requests</h3>

<p>Our network is part of an hierarchical system. Requests we cannot locate in
the region we send to the New York State Interlibrary Loan Network (NYSILL)
which searches the State Library in Albany and selected referral libraries in
the State. The key to the success of NYSILL is that it is asked only for
materials not available locally. The network would break down if the major
libraries were asked to supply commonly held materials. Medically oriented
requests not found on Long Island are transmitted to the Regional Medical Library
interlibrary loan network in Brooklyn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Public libraries submit their requests through their respective library systems,
which process the requests through LILRC, NYSILL, or other channels.</p>

<p>All other libraries in the region should submit their requests to LILRC. Most libraries
prefer to have local requests handled centrally, and decline to fill
regional requests unless they have been transmitted by the Council. In special
circumstances, libraries may arrange to deal directly with each other.</p>


<h3>Form of requests</h3>

<p>Borrowing libraries may find it helpful to develop worksheets (see samples in
<a href="#Appendix_B">Appendix B</a>) to be used by the reader and the librarian in preparing the
interlibrary loan request, indicating all the items we need to know.</p>

<p>Requests may be submitted on LILRC interlibrary loan forms which we supply,
and sent in by mail or by our driver. They may be placed by teletype, using
a format based on the LILRC request form. Urgent requests may be placed
by telephone.</p>

<p>We ask that you fill out the form as completely and as accurately as possible,
including author's full first name. Supply all the information you have been
able to elicit from your patron, as well as all you have been able to glean
from bibliographic sources to complete the request. The more information you
give us the more likely we are to locate the material you need&mdash;and the
more quickly.</p>

<p>Try to develop techniques for drawing from your reader as much as he knows
about the item he is seeking and the source of the citation. He must have
some reason for believing the item exists, and we should be able to pass this
information on to the potential lending library.</p>


<h3>Verification</h3>

<p>Check as far as possible to verify the accuracy of the information the reader
gives you. We trust that you will verify citations as completely and as
accurately as your resources will allow.</p>

<p>The ALA and NYSILL manuals (see <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>) both contain a listing of standard
bibliographic tools and sources of verification. Verification sources not
found in the standard lists should be cited in full. Remember that reference
tools and abbreviations familiar to you may not be known to the librarian trying
to fill the request. Please give full citation of the source of verification,
including date, volume, series, and the page on which verification was found.
That is, not just "NUC," but "NUC, 1968-72, 25:478." In a request for a
periodical article, both the title of the periodical and the location of the
article should be verified, and both sources of verification should be given.</p>

<p>If you cannot verify the item in a standard bibliographic tool, please supply
a complete citation to the source of reference, including author's full name,
publisher, date, and page of citation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>When libraries are unable to verify requests completely because their
bibliographic resources and staff are severely limited, we will <span class="u">try</span> to
verify the information and to locate the item. If a request is hopelessly
inadequate, with vital information missing or with incomprehensible
abbreviations, we will return it for clarification.</p>


<h3>OCLC verification</h3>

<p>Please use caution when citing OCLC numbers as verification for interlibrary
loan requests. The Council office and most of the libraries in our region
do not have OCLC terminals. Include OCLC #, author and title, place, publisher
and date, and Nassau-Suffolk and NYSILL locations where given.
Be sure all information has been copied correctly.</p>


<h3>Data base verification</h3>

<p>If an item is requested on the basis of a citation on a computer printout,
supply all information given and be sure to indicate which data base was
used, such as ERIC, Psych Abstracts, Compendex, BIOSIS, etc.</p>


<h3>Photocopying</h3>

<p>The lending library may choose to supply photocopies of articles in lieu
of lending whole issues or volumes of serials. By mutual agreement,
libraries in our region generally absorb the costs of photocopying articles,
although there may be a charge for longer articles. Libraries have usually
found that by photocopying for each other without charge they come
out reasonably even and avoid the expense and trouble of accounting and
billing procedures.</p>


<h3>Expenses</h3>

<p>LILRC along among the 3R's Councils in the State has chosen to maintain a
low membership fee which is the same for all libraries. Our income is
supplemented by a system of charges and credits for completed interlibrary
loan transactions, so that libraries pay in proportion to the use they make
of our service. These charges are not related to the cost of the service.</p>

<p>The borrowing library is charged a fee for each item it obtains through LILRC.
The lending library receives a credit (presently $1.00) equal to one-half
the charge (presently $2.00) for each item it supplies. Libraries with
collections from which we borrow heavily, paying for teletype machines to
receive our requests, may be given additional credit if replies are
transmitted promptly.</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="DIRECT_ACCESS_TO_OTHER_LIBRARIES" id="DIRECT_ACCESS_TO_OTHER_LIBRARIES"></a>DIRECT ACCESS TO OTHER LIBRARIES</h2>


<p>Both the Nassau Library System and the Suffolk Cooperative Library System
have policies of direct access, including borrowing privileges, among the
public libraries within their respective counties. A reader may find
another library convenient; remind him to check with his local public library
for details.</p>

<p>Other alternatives to interlibrary loan include:</p>


<h3>Location service</h3>

<p>It may be more practical for some readers to use books and periodicals at
the library which holds them rather than request them on interlibrary loan.
For periodicals, you may refer readers on the basis of the <span class="u">Nassau-Suffolk Union
List of Serials</span>. Please check the list of participating libraries in the front
of volume 1 which notes some limitations of public access to materials in
certain libraries.</p>

<p>For monographs, call LILRC and ask for a check of a few libraries in the microfilms
of card catalogs to get locations for needed items.</p>


<h3>Research Loan Program</h3>

<p>Through this program, patrons of participating libraries have direct access,
including circulation privileges, to specific subject area collections in other
participating libraries. In lieu of numerous interlibrary loan requests, libraries
may wish to recommend their readers take advantage of this program.
The latest LILRC membership list indicates libraries which have joined this
program. Details are available in all participating libraries and from LILRC.</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="INFORMATION_NETWORK_SERVICE-How_it_works" id="INFORMATION_NETWORK_SERVICE-How_it_works"></a>INFORMATION NETWORK SERVICE-How it works</h2>


<p>Requests are received daily from participating libraries by teletype and on
LILRC interlibrary loan forms by mail and delivery service. A limited number
of urgent requests may be received by telephone. All requests are transcribed
onto LILRC request forms if they have not arrived on that form.</p>

<p>All requests are checked to make sure that all necessary bibliographic information
has been given. If a glaring error or omission can be corrected
easily, the INS clerk will do so and process the request. If the error is
not easily corrected, the request is returned to the requesting library
for clarification.</p>

<p>When a monograph request is received, the clerk checks the appropriate catalogs
in the data bank of library card catalogs in microfilm in the LILRC office
(or calls libraries for materials not listed in the catalogs). For serials
the clerk checks the <span class="u">Nassau-Suffolk Union List of Serials</span> and other tools.
When an item is located, the clerk calls, teletypes a message, or sends a copy
of the request to the prospective lender to see if the item is actually available.</p>

<p>The INS staff tries to maintain a balance between locating the needed items
most efficiently and at the same time spreading the load so that the larger
libraries are not overburdened with requests and so that all libraries are
given a chance to build up credits.</p>

<p>Each time we check with a prospective lender, a notation is made on the
interlibrary loan form indicating the library's name and response. If "yes,"
arrangements are made for pickup. If "no," the search goes on. "Maybe" takes
a little longer; although the item is in the catalog, the shelf must be checked
to see if the volume is available for loan or photocopying.</p>

<p>When a loan is arranged, the clerk prepares the interlibrary loan forms
(still intact) for the driver. Having begun her run in the morning, delivering
books and copies picked up the previous day, the driver returns to the LILRC
office in the early afternoon with that day's deliveries and pickups. The driver
collects the day's batch of slips and prepares her itinerary for the next day.</p>

<p>Copies of the interlibrary loan form are used as follows:</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" summary="form">
<tr><td align='right'><span class="u">Serials</span></td><td align='left'>&nbsp;</td><td align='left'><span class="u">Books</span></td></tr>

before submitting request to LILRC</td><td align='left'>gold</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p>If an item is not located at a member library, the request is considered for
transmission to the State Library in Albany and the NYSILL network or to the
Regional Medical Library network. Certain categories of requests may be submitted
to the State Library but are not normally eligible for transmission
to NYSILL, such as: fiction, text books, current publications and those in
popular demand, rare books, genealogy, children's books, multi-volume sets,
reference books, non-research books (self-help, recreation, etc.).
Interlibrary loan librarians should familiarize themselves with the NYSILL
manual (see <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>) so they will know what to expect when we send requests
to NYSILL for them.</p>

<p>Each day, the requests not located on Long Island are teletyped to the State
Library in Albany. If available, the book or copy will be sent from the
State Library or the library to which it has been referred, directly to
the requesting library whose name and address have been coded into the NYSILL
transmission format. Medically-oriented requests are sent to the Regional Medical
Library network via the Medical Research Library in Brooklyn and may be sent to
the requesting library directly or via LILRC.</p>

<p>If the item is not available from any of these sources, a report is teletyped
to LILRC and we send it on to the requesting library.</p>


<h3>Billing</h3>

<p>Bills are sent quarterly unless a library asks that it be billed monthly or
semi-annually, or annually as part of the dues. The gold copy (part 4) of
the interlibrary loan form is included with the bill unless a library retains
it when initiating the request or indicates the copy need not be returned.</p>


<h3>Cancellations</h3>

<p>Occasionally, libraries find it necessary to cancel a request. It is understood
that if the item is in the process of being supplied the requesting library will
be charged for the completed loan.</p>


<h3>Delivery and pickup</h3>

<p>The Council drivers stop at each library which has a pickup or delivery to be
made (public libraries send materials to LILRC via their respective systems).
While the drivers stop nearly every day at the heaviest users, we do not know
you have something for us unless you let us know. If you are supplying a monograph
or photocopy, or have a book to return, <span class="u">call and tell us</span>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>


<h3>Microforms</h3>

<p>INS tries to obtain needed items in a form usable in the borrowing library.
If the supplying library cannot produce a hard copy of a microform it is
lending, and if your library does not have an appropriate reader, we will
try to have a copy made (if there is an additional charge you will be notified
in advance) or tell you where your patron can read or copy the material himself.</p>


<h3>Photocopies of missing pages</h3>

<p>Missing pages from monographs and serials may be requested in the usual manner.
For an additional fee, INS will try to obtain copies suitable for binding,
printed on both sides.</p>


<h3>Recall</h3>

<p>It is understood that the lending library may recall a book needed for one
of its own readers.</p>


<h3>Renewals</h3>

<p>Please request a renewal before the date due noted on the request form or
in the volume. For books received from LILRC member libraries, call the
LILRC office and give author, title, date due, library from which borrowed.
Renewals will usually be granted for two weeks from date due unless a lending
library has indicated otherwise.</p>

<p>Books received from the State Library or through NYSILL or the Regional Medical
Library must be renewed directly with the lending library, not LILRC.</p>


<h3>Returns</h3>

<p>Books received from LILRC should be returned via our driver. Call and let us
know you have a book to be returned.</p>

<p>Books received from the State Library or through NYSILL or the Regional Medical
Library should <span class="u">be mailed directly to the lending library</span>. The book usually
arrives with a return label. The package in which it comes will give information
regarding return address and insurance.</p>


<h3>Status reports</h3>

<p>Requests are processed and reports submitted to the requesting library as rapidly
as possible. It is not always possible to give an immediate report on the status
of an outstanding request in the process of being searched at a member library.
Please hold requests for status reports to a minimum.</p>

<p>The number of interlibrary loan requests received by LILRC is steadily
increasing. In order to process the requests efficiently we ask that
requests be submitted either on the LILRC interlibrary loan request
form or via teletype.</p>

<p>Please do not send requests on lists or in other formats. Telephone
requests can be accepted only for a limited number of urgent requests.</p>

<p>Use the "book" request form for all monographs, reports, whole volumes
of proceedings, transactions, congresses, etc.</p>

<p>Use "serials" request form for all articles from periodicals, papers
from transactions, proceedings or congresses, and for chapters or other
sections of books.</p>

<p>Please use LILRC interlibrary loan request forms only for requests sent
to LILRC.</p>

often number the requests consecutively each month. Thus, "10-59" would
indicate the fifty-ninth request Library X submitted to LILRC during
October. Libraries making fewer requests may number consecutively through
the year or may choose to omit a number.</p>

<p>3. <span class="u">Dewey No.</span> Supply three-digit Dewey number wherever known. This is necessary
for requests submitted to NYSILL so they can be referred to appropriate
subject referral libraries. Verification will often give Dewey number,
usually supplied with LC cataloging in NUC and NST.</p>

<p>4. <span class="u">Requesting library.</span> Name of institution submitting request. Since delivery
is through the LILRC driver, full mailing address is not needed.</p>

renewals may not always be granted.</p>

<p><span class="u">Encourage</span> your readers to take full notes of bibliographic sources
and references, to supply all necessary data, to fill out a work
sheet for each request.</p>

<p><span class="u">Screen</span> requests carefully. Eliminate requests for items that are
too new, too popular, too inexpensive to process, too ephemeral.</p>

<p><span class="u">VERIFY</span> all citations.</p>

<p><span class="u">Make sure</span> your teletype messages and interlibrary loan forms are free
from typographical errors.</p>

<p><span class="u">Return</span> materials promptly. If a renewal is necessary, ask for it
before the date due. If a book is lost, notify the Council and
pay the bill promptly. Your library is responsible for all books
it borrows on interlibrary loan. Books received through NYSILL
should be returned directly to the lending library, not to LILRC.</p>

<p><span class="u">Limit</span> the number of items you request on behalf of any reader at
one time. Materials on a given subject should not be monopolized
by one patron in the region, and deadlines and due dates must be honored.</p>
